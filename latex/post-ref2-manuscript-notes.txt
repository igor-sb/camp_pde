Manuscript summary

1. Introduction. Establish relevance, previous work, etc. DONE

2. SNR. Intuitevely explain what it is on a simple example, Fig.1. DONE

3. Numerical simulations. Fixed PDE secretion rate model.
   Show: (1) Fig.2a. SNR fancy plot. Show there is a range where PDE improves SNR. DONE
         (2) Fig.2b. PDE can improve SNR only for concentrations > Kd. Intuitive explanation. DONE
         (3) Fig.2cd. PDE can broaden the detection range of cAMP.
         (4) Fig.2ef. CI(SNR) is improved. f shows something you could measure.
         
4. Analytical / exact solutions, uniform PDE model. 
   With this model, we can show exact solutions for cAMP concentration, gradient, 
   signal, noise, SNR. 
   Show: (1) Fig.3a. SNR looks very similar to previous model. Mention in the text
             that only local cAMP gradient (near the cell) is what is important. 
         (2) Fig.3b. PDE changes SNR by changing both dc and c, but not with dc ~ c.
         (3) Show the increase in receptor number?
                  
5. Discussion
	- Mention cases other than dc/c = const (e.g. dc = const, and c = const for which I have the data) and refer to the results in the SI for both SNR and CI. 
	- Mention spherical model, refer to the results in the SI.
