@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Zero-normal cAMP flux seems reasonable since the time scale for receptor internalization is 5 minutes [A. Serge et al. Integr. Biol., 3, 675-683, 2011] compared to the time scale of receptor dissociation of 1 second [M. Ueda et al. Science, 294, 864-867, 2001], so the binding and unbinding processes are in equilibrium."}
